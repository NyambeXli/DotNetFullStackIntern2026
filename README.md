🚀 Project Milestone: BookFlow Full-Stack System
> **Status:** Project milestone completed but will remain under construction for improvement of new ideas.

📚 BookFlow: Full-Stack Library Management System
BookFlow is an enterprise-grade library management solution designed for high-concurrency environments. 
It enables users to seamlessly browse and interact with a vast catalog, while providing administrators with 
robust tools to manage book availability, metadata, and circulation logistics.

🌟 Key Features
High Concurrency Engine: Engineered to allow multiple users to access and interact with the same resource 
simultaneously without performance degradation.

Dynamic Circulation Tracking: Real-time monitoring of book availability and automated "Return Time" calculations.

Admin Command Center: Secure dashboard for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and the ability 
to "Hide" books for maintenance or exclusive access.

User Discovery: Responsive browsing experience with advanced filtering for book discovery.

🚀 Project Roadmap & Milestones
This repository follows a structured development path covering three phases of enterprise .NET engineering. 
Each phase focuses on specific architectural patterns and modern deployment strategies.

Phase 1: Core Foundations
System Architecture: In-depth exploration of the .NET Ecosystem, comparing .NET Framework, .NET Core, 
and the unified .NET 5/6/7/8+ platforms.
OOP & Engineering Standards: Strict implementation of advanced C# concepts, focusing on SOLID principles, 
encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure code maintainability.

Phase 2: Intermediate Implementation
Full-Stack Web Development: Engineering responsive web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC architecture and the Razor engine.
Security & Identity: Implementing robust Authentication and Authorization protocols, utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and 
OAuth 2.0 for secure data exchange.

Phase 3: Advanced Cloud & Microservices
Distributed Systems: Transitioning from Monolithic to Microservices-based architecture, utilizing RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.
Containerization: Full orchestration of the environment using Docker for environment consistency.
Azure Cloud Operations: Deployment via Azure App Services with automated CI/CD pipelines for high availability.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core MVC
Security: JWT, Identity Framework
Database: SQL Server / Entity Framework Core
Messaging: RabbitMQ
DevOps: Docker, Azure App Service, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
